## **Eye safety**

LED emitted light can cause eye injury. Precautions should be taken to avoid viewing bright LEDs with unprotected eyes. More information can be found [here](https://www.cree.com/led-components/media/documents/XLamp_EyeSafety.pdf). Always cover LEDs with a protective filter/diffuser to ensure that brightness levels are safe.
